## GO enrichment network plot of DEG and DET

sample code in https://github.com/yerry77/TG-full-length/blob/main/result%20visualization/GO%20enrichment%20network%20plot%20of%20DEG%20and%20DET.r

To visualize the functions of differentially expressed genes and genes expressing differentially expressed isoforms, functional enrichment of these genes was performed and visualized.

## seqlogo plot

sample code in https://github.com/yerry77/TG-full-length/blob/main/result%20visualization/seqlogo%20plot.r

We visualized exon-intron boundaries for known and novel isoforms and examined whether splice sites adhered to canonical motifs (GT/GC/AT at the 5' site and AG/AC at the 3' site).

## visualize novel isoforms in TG and their existence in other tissues

sample code in https://github.com/yerry77/TG-full-length/blob/main/result%20visualization/visualize%20novel%20isoforms%20in%20TG%20and%20their%20existence%20in%20other%20tissues.r

To more accurately characterize the tissue specificity of the novel isoforms discovered in TG, we quantified the expression of genes and novel isoforms using long-read RNA sequencing data 
from nine mouse organs and cell lines from the ENCODE project and visualized the results using t-SNE and heatmaps.
