## Project Title
Long-read Sequencing Uncovers Novel Alternative Splicing Networks Governing Neuroimmune in an Allergic Rhinitis Mouse model

## Abstract
This repository contains scripts, processed data, and analysis pipelines for investigating novel isoforms in the trigeminal ganglion using full-length transcriptome sequencing.

This study identified novel isoforms, quantified transcript expression levels, and provided analysis pipelines and plotting scripts.
